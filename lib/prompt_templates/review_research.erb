A research assistant has prepared a summary of relevant data for a superforecaster based on this question:

<%= FORECAST_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.result(binding) -%>

Here is the summary of relevant data that was prepared:
<research>
<%= @research_output %>
</research>

<%- unless %w[sonar-reasoning sonar-reasoning-pro sonar-deep-research].include?(llm.model) -%>
- Before responding, show step-by-step reasoning in clear, logical order starting with `<think>` on the line before and ending with `</think>` on the line after.
<%- end -%>
- After responding, provide actionable recommendations to improve the prompt's effectiveness with reasoning explanations starting with `<reflect>` on the line before and ending with `</reflect>` on the line after.

Review the summary of relevant data and provide actionable recommendations to the research assistant on how to improve the research quality.
